# Janisaltherr.com
This is the website source code for janisaltherr.com, my personal homepage. It has been written in plain HTML and
ES2016. No lib, no compiler, no polyfill.

## Technologies
I live on the edge of technologies, and so does my website. Using un-polyfilled ES2017 does come at the expense of
not having the biggest browser coverage. But technology only really advances by taking a leap of faith, right?

I did not use any library, though this project spawned [Gripple.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gripple.js), the
engine running this page. I did use webpack-dev-server for development, though.
